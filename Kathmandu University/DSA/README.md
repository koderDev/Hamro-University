# Data Structures and Algorithms

This folder contains reference implementations for foundational data structures and algorithms. The code is written in Python for readability and quick experimentation.

## Files

- `linked_list.py`: Minimal singly linked list with insert, delete, and traversal operations.
- `binary_search_tree.py`: Binary search tree supporting insertion, lookup, deletion, and traversals.
- `sorting.py`: Implementations of bubble sort, insertion sort, merge sort, and quicksort with a shared test harness.
- `searching.py`: Linear search and binary search routines with sanity checks.

Run a file directly to see a simple demonstration of the implementation.
