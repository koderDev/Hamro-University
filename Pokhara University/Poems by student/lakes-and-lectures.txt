“Between Lakes and Lectures”

Beneath Machhapuchhre’s silver glow,
I chase my dreams where rivers flow.
Pages flutter in the mountain breeze,
Between the pine and blooming trees.

The lecture ends, yet thoughts remain,
Of futures built through joy and strain.
Friends and laughter fill the air,
In every challenge, hope is there.

The lake reflects our restless youth,
Our search for love, for light, for truth.
Pokhara hums, serene yet wild—
Each dawn reborn, each heart beguiled.

And when the stars on Begnas gleam,
I close my eyes to chase the dream—
A world to build, a path to find,
With courage clear and open mind.
